# BigInt-C

A lightweight C library for performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large integers. Built from scratch to overcome the limitations of standard integer types in C (`int`, `long`, etc.), this project also served as a personal learning exercise in **linked lists** and **pointer manipulation**.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This project was created to:
- Implement **big integer support** in C (similar to BigInteger in other languages)
- Practice and deepen understanding of **linked lists** and **pointers**
- Build a fully working custom math library using only the C standard library

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Represent integers of arbitrary size using linked lists
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division
- 🧠 Built using raw pointers and dynamic memory
- 🧪 Lightweight and dependency-free
